# de Broglie Relation
In classical mechanics, the momentum of a particle $$p$$ can be found by finding the product of a particle's mass $$m$$ and the particle's velocity $$v$$. 

$$p = m \cdot v$$

## Consider this sine wave:

## Can we express the speed of this light in terms of frequency?
> We know that speed is the ratio of distance travelled over time. Thus if we let wavelength $$\lambda$$ be distance travelled and time at $$2\pi$$ $$t_{2\pi}$$ be the time interval of interest, we get

> $$c = \frac{\lambda}{t_{2\pi}}$$

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$
$$ E = mc^{2} $$
$$ E = h\nu $$
